            <p class="bodytext">The macro-economic is prevalent to us, affecting our lives in both obvious and subtle ways; however, those technical factors are convoluted. Even knowing the importance, we are reluctant to analyse the world economy because it involves dull
                numbers and texts. If you feel the same way, do not worry. "A picture is worth a thousand words". (!! italic) Data visualization using Vega-Lite makes it more interesting to read. Through this article, I am trying to demostrate how those
                economic indicators could more vivid and hopefully you can obtain insights on global macro-economic situation.
            </p>

            <p class="bodytext"> Before reading on, bear in mind that I am not an expert in Economics (but at high-school level) (!!Italic) so the analysis might be a constraint. Also, it is better to have a little knowledge on Economics like what GDP is.</p>
            <p class="bodytext">The following sections illustrate how different factors can affect the global macroeconomics.

            <p class="bodytext">
                By selecting bar of a specific country from the chart below, this helps filter the scatter plot above.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext"> Let's takes an example of the U.S:</p>
            <p class="bodytext"> According to the bar chart, the U.S has always been ranked to have the highest. When select the bar of the U.S, you can see that only points of the U.S being highlighted. From 1974 - 1981, the us has experienced the soared inflation, ranging
                from 5.5% to 9.5%. This is because there were Central bank policy, the abandonment of the gold window, wage and price controls under Nixon administration, Keynesian economic policy, and market psychology contributing to high inflation
                in 1970s. Another interesting thing is that Japan, the U.K and the U.S experienced its highest inflation between 1973 and 1975. Could you find out what happened during those years?
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">In terms of income, you can view the size of points that are of similar sizes; which means that the income has not changed much across the years. However, the points in 1967, 1995, 2004, 2016, and 2021 are relatively small. It is easy to guess
                what big events triggered this event, like COVID-19.</p>

                        while a country that exports more goods and services than it imports has a trade surplus(!! italic) . In 2019, Germany had the largest trade surplus (5.8%) followed by China (1.2%) and Japan (0.2%). Whereas the U.S had the largest
                        trade deficit, even with the ongoing trade war with China, beating out the United Kingdom.

                <p class="bodytext">In a nutshell, GDP is the entire market value of all goods and services a country produces within a certain amount of time. The charts illustrates the change of the contribution across the three sectors. Interestingly, the top 5 economies
                    do not rely on the agriculture as most of them weights less than 15 % (!! italic). Maybe it is because the foods can be imported from other countries. Across the years, the most important drives come from the sector of service, with
                    more than 40% (!! italic).
                </p>
                <p class="bodytext">Speaking of China — the highest-growth country, the contribution from the sectors of agriculture and industrial have been receding meanwhile the service sector rise rapidly. We can tell that China is going through a economic transformation
                    (!! italic). A question in my mind is that since the contribution of agriculture has been decreasing dramatically, do you think China can support themselves without any imported foods? </p>

                </p>
                <p class="bodytext">It means the economic growth brought on by a change in the structure of a country’s population, usually a result of a fall in fertility and mortality rates. If the population is large enough (≥ 100M) like China, and people are leading
                    a long lifespan, it means that its working condition is satisfactory enough to increase the productivity. This is important as it boosts per capita income. To measure the Demographic dividends, you can also look at the savings, labor
                    supply, human capital, and economic growth of the countries.

                    <p class="bodytext">Foreign investment refers to the investment in domestic companies and assets of another country by a foreign investor. They can be made by individuals, but are most often endeavors pursued by companies and corporations with substantial
                        assets looking to expand their reach. A simple sense is that a high inflow from country means that the country has a high potential growth. So, if you move around the year bar below the chart, you can perceive that the inflow is
                        always larger than the outflow, meanwhile Japan always goes conversely. Perhaps we can say that as globalization increases, many multinational corporations will seek new opportunities for economic growth by opening branches and
                        expanding their investments in countries like China.

                    in Europe, Canada, Australia and the U.S are of high development with valued roughly 90%. Therefore, we can infer that countries in Africa have the lowest standard of living with a relatively poor health of people; meanwhile countries
